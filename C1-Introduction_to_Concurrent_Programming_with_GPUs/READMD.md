## Introduction to Concurrent Programming with GPUs

### M2: Core Principles of Parallel Programming on CPUs and GPUs

1. concurrent programming pitfalls:
- race conditions
- resource contention
- dead lock
- live lock
- resource under- and over-utilization

2. concurrent programming challenges:
- dining philosophers
- producer-consumer
- sleeping barber
- data and code synchronization
  
3. concurrent programming patterns:
- divide and conquer
- map-reduce
- repository
- pipelines and workflows: directed acyclic graph
- recursion:
- 

4. Serial Versus Parallel Code and Flynn's Taxonomy
- serial search pseudocode
- parallel search pseudocode
- Flynn's Taxonomy
